Moodle Lightbox Gallery for Moodle 2.x

 * INSTALL *

Be sure to always install the stable branch that matches your moodle version!
The master branch is compatible with the latest Moodle and not guarenteed to work on earlier versions.
If you are on M2.1 for example, you should be installing the copy from the MOODLE_21_STABLE branch.

untar/unzip and move the "netspotau-moodle-mod_lightboxgallery-aa1f7d1" resulted folder within
moodle/mod folder. Moodle will not detect the new plugin unless you rename it to moodle/mod/lightboxgallery

 * ABOUT *

This resource allows you to create 'Lightbox' enabled image galleries within your Moodle course. The
Lightbox system is a set of scripts than can be used to apply nice effects to image galleries - more
info can be found at http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox2/

As a course teacher, you are able to create, edit and delete galleries. Smallthumbnails will then be
generated, which are used for the thumbnail view of the gallery.

Clicking on any of the thumbnails brings that image into focus, and allows you to scroll through the
gallery at your leisure. Using the Lightbox scripts creates nice transition effects when loading and
scrolling through the images.

This plugin was designed for Moodle version 2.0 and upwards
